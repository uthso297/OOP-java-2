 * 
 * Consider that you have been hired to design and develop a part of university
 * management system.
 * 
 * For the first version of the system, you are required to store the
 * information of all the Teachers, Students, Staff, and Courses. For Teachers,
 * Students, and Staff you must store first name, last name, department, and
 * age. Teachers and staff also have Employee Id and monthly salary. The student
 * has Student Id and Course information that he has enrolled in. Course info
 * includes course title, course code and credit hours.
 * 
 * In every semester, a course is assigned to course a teacher and when a
 * student is enrolled in a course then the number of enrolled students
 * increased.
 * 
 * Now, convert the Scenario to code Ensuring Encapsulation & Inheritance.
 * 
 * Step-1: Give at least one Teacher, Student, Staff and Course info. Then show
 * all info.
 * 
 * Step-2: Need to calculate Teachers and Staff yearly salary and Teachers have
 * 10% allowance and staff have a 50% bonus.
 * 
 * Finally, We also need to know that how many students are enrolled in a
 * specific subject and Total credit hours are taken by Specific teaches.
